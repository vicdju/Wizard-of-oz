                <p>One of the true classics of American literature, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has stirred the
                    imagination of young and old alike for over four generations. Originally published in 1900, it was
                    the first truly American fairy tale, as Baum crafted a wonderful out of such familiar items as a
                    cornfield scarecrow, a mechanical woodman, and a humbug wizard who used old-fashioned hokum to
                    express that universal theme. "There's no place like home."</p>
